## Introduction

### Mission Statement

Applying for jobs can be tedious but with Follow Up, it doesnâ€™t have to! With resourcefulness and determination, we can work together to give your application more consideration than the competition and get you into that interview with the jobs you want. Keeping up with multiple job applications can be a strenuous task. Let us join you in your job search by offering organization and peace of mind. We remind you to follow up with employers on job opportunities. Why does this work? This is something that very few potential candidates do. While the competition waits by the phone, Follow Up reminds you to pick it up and take initiative. Follow Up is your guide to a successful job search experience, everytime. Follow Up, reminding you to remind them.

## Unsolved Problems
We would have liked to add an API to be able to send the user an email using the email they applied with.
Another thing that we would have done with more time is make the NavBar only show the appropriate links, for example if you are already logged in, login will not be an option for the user.

## Future Enhancements

- User able to search for job through webapp
- Job transitions to red if not available
- Create reminder to go to users contact information
- Use bootstrap with REACT components
